# Phasix — Development Changelog
One entry per session. Format: `[DATE] vX.X — What was built / decided / changed.`
Kept in version control. Claude Code reads this to avoid re-litigating settled work.

## Log

[2026-03] Pre-development planning complete
- Built: GDD v0.7.9, Technical Directive v0.1.0, Roadmap v2 (GDD-aligned, 20-month plan)
- Built: ClaudeCode_Primer.md (311 lines, full GDD constraint set)
- Built: CLAUDE.md (auto-load summary for Claude Code sessions)
- Built: DECISIONS.md (implementation decisions register, initially seeded)
- Built: CHANGELOG.md (this file)
- Decided: Unity 2D URP, Asset Store art pipeline, A* Pathfinding Project (free), DOTween for tweening
- Decided: Development path = Asset Store sprites first, no custom art pipeline until post-demo
- Decided: Claude Code used for scripting with CLAUDE.md auto-loaded per session
- Decided: Creature classifier working name = Phasix (not yet written into GDD — pending confirmation)
- Decided: Art style TBD — Hades-style pre-render pipeline deferred, not ruled out
- Pending: Unity project not yet created — Phase 1 begins next
- Next: Create Unity LTS project, configure 2D URP, set up Git repo, create folder structure

[2026-03] Game renamed
- Decided: Game title changed from "Project Mon-Farm" to "Phasix"
- Note: "Phasix" now serves as both the game title AND the creature classifier name
- Note: GDD still references Mon-Farm internally — pending GDD update to reflect rename
- Note: All Docs/ files updated to reflect new name
