# Phasix — Numerical Calibration Register
**Version:** 1.1.0 · **Updated:** March 2026  
**Status: PENDING — Phase 2 calibration design task**  
All values here are PENDING. Do not hardcode any of these in scripts — use named constants or ScriptableObject fields with placeholder values and a `// TODO` comment.

---

## How to Use This File
- When a value is decided through playtesting, fill in the "Final" column and date it
- Update the corresponding script constant or ScriptableObject field
- Add a CHANGELOG entry referencing the calibration decision
- Claude Code reads this file to know which values are still pending vs locked

## Aptitude (NEW — Progression_Directive_v0_1_0.md)

### Aptitude thresholds for exotic evolution branches
These are per-branch values — designed during species roster phase. General guidance:
| Branch Rarity | Aptitude Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rare branch | PENDING | Requires meaningful cycling history |
| Very rare branch | PENDING | |
| Legendary branch | PENDING | |

---

## Evolution Thresholds

### Stat minimums per tier transition (replaces level floors — Progression_Directive_v0_1_0)
| Tier Transition | Stat Minimum Gate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| T1→T2 | PENDING | Low — anti-exploit, natural play hits quickly |
| T2→T3 | PENDING | |
| T3→T4 | PENDING | |
| T4→T5 | PENDING | |

Note: Old level floor table retained below for reference — superseded by stat minimums above.

### Evolution pacing targets (Aura model)
| Transition | Target Sessions | Design Intent |
|---|---|---|
| T1→T2 | 1–2 sessions | Fast — builds attachment early |
| T2→T3 | Few sessions | Moderate — first realm exploration required |
| T3→T4 | Notable investment | Multi-realm Aura required |
| T4→T5 | Significant investment | Deep cross-realm + rare variant required |

### Old level floor values (SUPERSEDED — reference only)
| Tier Transition | Level Floor |
|---|---|
| T1→T2 | PENDING (superseded) |
| T2→T3 | PENDING (superseded) |
| T3→T4 | PENDING (superseded) |
| T4→T5 | PENDING (superseded) |

## Unnamed Pool

### Growth formula
```
poolGrowth = (excessStatsAboveFloor × bondMultiplier)
```
Note: With Aptitude raising the stat ceiling, players who devolve at higher Aptitude will have accumulated more stats above the base floor — resulting in larger pool gains. This is intentional.

| Bond % | bondMultiplier |
|---|---|
| 0–19% (Stranger) | PENDING |
| 20–39% (Familiar) | PENDING (small) |
| 40–59% (Companion) | PENDING (moderate) |
| 60–79% (Partner) | PENDING (significant) |
| 80–99% (Bonded) | PENDING (large) |
| 100% (Complete) | PENDING (maximum) |

---

| Complete survival task together | PENDING | Medium |
| Devo/re-evo cycle | PENDING | Highest single action |
| Exploration passive | PENDING | Minor over time |
| Preferred Origin activity | 2× multiplier on base gain | Locked |

### Loss % per event
| Tier | Amount | Examples |

| Micro | 0.5–1% | Flee, lose battle, left in reserve |
| Minor | 2–3% | Corruption overuse, repeated fleeing |
| Significant | 5–8% | Sustained Corruption abuse |
| Session cap | 5% max | Locked |

---

## Battle System Values
